<h2> ABOUT THE CHALLENGE </h2> 
TITLE : Eclipses: Perspective is Everything


Eclipses are awe-inspiring celestial events that drastically change the appearance of one of the two biggest objects we see in our sky: our Sun and Moon. On Earth, people can experience eclipses when Earth, the Moon, and the Sun align. Your challenge is to create a game, activity, or story for young learners that explains the mechanics of eclipses, including eclipse seasons, how and why eclipses occur, and why only some people on Earth can see an eclipse at a given time.

<h2> WHAT EXACTLY DOES IT DO? HOW DOES IT WORK? </h2> 

Space Trainer is an interactive graphic novel that teaches the player all he needs about eclipses through an engaging story. As soon as the player press the button start the adventure begins with a brief introduction about the context of the story, the player find itself in NASA 's facility, ready to go to space and learn all he needs to know about eclipses to become a space expert. Once the player reach the space station, he will have access to two rooms, the eclipse gallery and the classroom.

ECLIPSE GALLERY


In this room the player will be able to watch different videos about eclipses, that include explanations about the phenomenon, interesting facts about eclipses, and some of the dates in which people where able to see these phenomena in the sky.

CLASSROOM

This is the place where John will teach the lessons about the different types of eclipse, giving out information about the causes of this phenomenon, how it looks in different perspectives, interesting information about each one and the preventive measures needed in case you want to watch one yourself in real life.

As the player keep completing this lessons, a bar showing your progress will start to fill up until you have completed them all. This lessons will include games to test the knowledge obtained throughout the course, and once the bar is filled to the max, a new button will be unlocked at the starting page to access the different games, in case you want to play them again.

<h2>WHAT BENEFITS DOES IT HAVE? WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO ACHIEVE?</h2> 

Learning, especially a scientific topic, can be heavy and boring for young people, sometimes it's not easy to know where to start and it requires long readings of articles and information that can make the experience not enjoyable. That's why, to reach the younger generations, it is better to have more interactive and visual approach that can resonate with them.

Not only does the game have all the information for needed synthesized, but it is also design to guide the player in all the the steps of the learning process along with educational videos and games.

Our hope is to make the experience of learning something fun and easy to digest, and give people motivation to keep learning about the beauties of our universe from a young age, in hopes of inspiring more people to follow the scientific path.

<h2> USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE </h2> 

We did use Artificial Intelligence in our solution. The use of the AI Stable Diffusion was essential in the making of the game, especially as a tool to reduce the amount of effort needed to make the different scenarios of "Space Trainer: Eclipse Expedition". Additionally, we worked with ChatGPT mostly for improving the writing of the script in the videos used as educational content.
